# Algorithms

## Intro and examples of some algorithm using JavaScript.

1. Binary Search
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Recursive Algorithms
5. Tower of Hanoi
6. Merge Sort
7. Quick Sort
8. Graph Representation
9. Breadth-first Search

## Asymptotic Notation

1. Big-Theta - Big-Θ - Asymptotic tight bound - Both upper and lower bound
2. Big-O - Big-O - Asymptotic upper bound
3. Big-Omega - Big-Ω - Asymptotic lower bound
    

## Here's is the list of functions in asymptotic notation that we often encounter when analyzing algorithms, ordered from slowest to fastest growing: 

1. Θ(1)
2. Θ(log<sub>2</sub> n) 
3. Θ(n)
4. Θ(n log<sub>2</sub> n)
5. Θ(n<sup>2</sup>)
6. Θ(n<sup>2</sup> log<sub>2</sub> n)
7. Θ(n<sup>3</sup>)
8. Θ(2<sup>n</sup>)
9. Θ(n!)
